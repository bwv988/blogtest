title: Overriding proxy settings for Git

When working with multiple Git repositories, I sometimes find myself having to override my current HTTP proxy setting (e.g. a corporate proxy) when pushing modifications to a public GitHub project. But doing so is actually really straight-forward.

Simply execute the following inside the public repository you're intending to push:
{% highlight bash %}
    git config --add remote.origin.proxy ""
{% endhighlight %}
