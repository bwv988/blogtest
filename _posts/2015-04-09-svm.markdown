**Support Vector Machines**, often when used in conjunction with the so-called "Kernel Trick", are among the most powerful off-the shelf machine learning algorithms for supervised learning. That is, in cases where a classification model is sought for a desired outcome, and this model can be build based on training data which contains the expected outcome for each data row.

The below report is a comparative analysis on the predictive performance of Support Vector Machines using a range of different _kernels_ vs. the Random Forest algorithm.
