About
========
This is my personal blog where I write about the nerdy stuff I find interesting.

Although primarily intended as a notebook for myself, perhaps -- the almighty Google Bot permitting -- there will be one or two things which may be pertinent to others too. ;)

## Technical
This site is hosted from my [Github repo](https://github.com/bwv988) and _automagically_ re-generated into a static web page using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).

Posts are written using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
